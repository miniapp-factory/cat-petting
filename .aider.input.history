+Code the following app
+```
+Create a fully functional and interactive cat petting application where users can pet an adorable animated cat character displayed prominently in the center of the screen, and when the user clicks or taps anywhere on the cat's body, it should trigger delightful visual reactions including animated floating hearts that rise upward, colorful sparkles or star particles that appear around the touch point, the cat's facial expression changing to show contentment with eyes closing or a smile appearing, accompanied by a purring sound effect that plays with each pet, while simultaneously incrementing a visible happiness meter or pet counter displayed at the top of the screen that shows how many times the cat has been petted, and include a selection menu or buttons that allow users to switch between at least 3-4 different cat breeds or color variations such as orange tabby, gray cat, black cat, and calico cat, with each breed having its own unique appearance, implement smooth CSS animations and transitions for all interactive elements to make the experience feel polished and responsive, use a warm and inviting color scheme with pastel backgrounds like soft pink, lavender, or cream colors, add cute UI elements like paw print decorations, whisker details, or fish bone icons, include a clearly visible reset button that allows users to start the happiness counter over from zero, ensure the cat image or illustration is large enough to be the focal point taking up most of the screen space, make all interactive feedback instantaneous so users feel rewarded immediately when they pet the cat, and optionally add encouraging text messages that appear randomly like "Your cat is so happy!", "Keep petting!", or "Purr-fect!" to enhance the user experience and make the app feel alive and engaging.

+Make sure all visual effects like hearts and sparkles are implemented as actual animated HTML elements or SVG graphics that are dynamically created with JavaScript when the cat is clicked, positioned absolutely at the click coordinates, and animated upward with CSS keyframe animations including fade-out effects before being removed from the DOM after the animation completes, and ensure the purring sound is loaded from a CDN like https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ion-sound/3.0.7/sounds/bell_ring.mp3 or use the Web Audio API to generate a purring-like sound programmatically, and make certain that all event listeners are properly attached to the cat element with click handlers that actually execute the animation creation functions, and verify that z-index values are set correctly so effects appear above the cat image, and use requestAnimationFrame or setTimeout to properly time the removal of effect elements after animations finish, and include console.log statements to debug and confirm that click events are firing and effect elements are being created and added to the page.
